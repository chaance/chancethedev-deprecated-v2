# Chance The Developer Podcast

[New site, who dis?](https://chancethedev.com)

Yes, I know. I overengineered the hell out of this. It's a landing page built with React, TypeScript, and compiled into static HTML. It's stupid but it's mine, and it was fun to make.

To run this site, open your terminal, navigate to the directory you want to store the files in, and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chancestrickland/chancethedev.git
cd chancethedev
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Open https://localhost:8000
